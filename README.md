ERDOS - Towards End-to-End Compute Graph Optimization with Graph Neural Networks

Motivation : 

    * The Complexity of Machine Learning Models increases.
    * Computational Demand increases.
    
But the Models can be optimized to a certain extent only.

Solution :

    Optimization of device placement - Computational Graphs - ML Models

Goal : 

    To find the best Graph Neural Network (GNN) to perform Node Classification. 

Problem Statement : 

    Existing learning based approaches are sample inefficient -
    * Tackle a single optimization problem.
    * Do not generalize to unseen graphs which makes it infeasible.
